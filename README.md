# Real-Time Data Dashboard 🌦️🌍💻



This real-time data dashboard is an application that displays weather information in a visually appealing and interactive way. The dashboard uses Power BI to retrieve real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it on a map using Leaflet JS. The data is updated in real-time using SignalR, allowing users to see the latest weather conditions without having to refresh the page.
